        Dating is not love.<br>
        Talking to someone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is not love.<br>
        Staying awake for someone all night is not love either.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
        Love is when someone sees your war side and still chooses to love you.<br>
        It's when they do things for you, especially when you can't do them for yourself.<br>
        It is when they hold you close and calm you down when tears stream down your face.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
        Love is when they see all the good in you even when all you see is bad.<br>
        It is someone who makes sure you are okay even when they are not.<br>
        It is someone who thinks of you every day, every night.<br>
        It is someone who is constantly devoted to you.<br>
        <strong>That is what love is.</strong>

        And maybe, just maybeâ€”some broken clocks donâ€™t need to be replacedâ€¦ they just need to be wound back gently, and given one more chance to tick in time again.
